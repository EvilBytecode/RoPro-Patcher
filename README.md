# RoPro Patcher

This tool automatically patches the [RoPro](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ropro-enhance-your-roblox/adbacgifemdbhdkfppmeilbgppmhaobf?hl=en-GB) extension, enabling you to access the `pro_tier` for free.

> [Note] This is mainly for DaHood players, allowing them to play on specific server regions without paying for RoPro.
